There are plenty of free resources to learn R. Some possible starting points are given at [RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/). If you find particularly nice tutorials or resources, why not post about them in the comments below?\n\nThat will allow for a flying start to the course.\n\n## Watch video introducing mizer\"\n\nIn this video Ken Andersen introduces many of the concepts that we will be discussing in this course. However don't feel that you have to take it all in at once. We will come back to these topics (and others) during the course where we hope to make them concrete by working hands-on with mizer.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_c457083b648be24b852b7d22727c7f5d'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"vembedr\" align=\"center\">\n<div class=\"vembedr-rounded\" style=\"border-radius: 10px;\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_AeywguOA0o\" width=\"533\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
